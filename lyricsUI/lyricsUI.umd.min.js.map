获取到当前句歌词和上一句歌词的DOM元素，获取他们的高度再操作DOM进行滚动（两个DOM元素高度的一半之和再加外边距）\r\n    touchmove导致top定位失准\r\n      使用scrollTop代替top\r\n    如果最后用户手指快速离开屏幕出现惯性滚动时，会出现由于对touchmove事件进行了节流导致其在touchend事件后延迟触发，导致定时器被清除\r\n      取消节流\r\n    维护当前高亮歌词nIndex和index，判断其是否相等，若相等则无需操作DOM用以提高性能，但是会出现滑动结束后需要回位时，若歌词还是停留在原句，则无法回位\r\n      取消该行为\r\n    防止惯性滚动时就回位\r\n      将touchend定时器的延迟设的长一些\r\n  打包后出现的问题：\r\n
