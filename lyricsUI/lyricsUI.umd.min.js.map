1、监听audio元素上的timeupdate事件，实时获取当前时间\r\n      2、v-for遍历歌词（带有对应时间），歌词首次onUpdated的时候计算出每句歌词对应的scrollTop(该属性在touchmove事件下不会失效，而top属性会失效)滚动距离，放在数组中\r\n      3、watch监听当前时间并与每句歌词对应的时间进行对比，使用JS操作DOM（scrollTop属性）进行滚动到对应歌词的位置\r\n    2、滑屏时停止歌词自动滚动并显示播放按钮、横线和当前滑动到的歌词对应的时间\r\n      1、touchmove事件触发时watch监听时间进行歌词滚动的行为暂停\r\n      2、在touchmove事件里控制横线的显示\r\n      3、根据横线和每句歌词的相对位置（此处获取横线和每句歌词距离屏幕的y距离），\r\n        如果某句歌词的y小于横线的y并且下一句歌词的y大于横线的y，那么就获取该句歌词对应的时间显示出来\r\n      4、touchend时延迟取消显示，并将该计时器id保存下来，下次进入touchmove时取消未执行的计时器\r\n    3、滑屏结束时点击播放按钮跳转到所滑到的位置\r\n      改变时间即可（watch会监听到时间变化进行自动跳转）\r\n    4、滑屏结束不点击播放按钮1s后自动回到播放位置\r\n      监听touchmove属性，当它发生变化且当前状态为false时将歌词滚动到对应位置\r\n  bugs：    \r\n    歌词超出长度折行后导致歌词高度不同，如何计算高度：\r\n      获取到当前句歌词和上一句歌词的DOM元素，获取他们的高度再操作DOM进行滚动（两个DOM元素高度的一半之和再加外边距）\r\n    touchmove导致top定位失准\r\n      使用scrollTop代替top\r\n    如果最后用户手指快速离开屏幕出现惯性滚动时，会出现由于对touchmove事件进行了节流导致其在touchend事件后延迟触发，导致定时器被清除\r\n      取消节流\r\n    维护当前高亮歌词nIndex和index，判断其是否相等，若相等则无需操作DOM用以提高性能，但是会出现滑动结束后需要回位时，若歌词还是停留在原句，则无法回位\r\n      取消该行为\r\n    防止惯性滚动时就回位\r\n      将touchend定时器的延迟设的长一些\r\n  打包后出现的问题：\r\n    getCurrentInstance在生产环境下与开发环境下不同，生产环境下无法获取到实例\r\n      原先使用proxy.refs获取子元素，现在直接使用ref并return出去即可获取\r\n\r\n    \r\n*/ \r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n  .lyricsContainer{\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n
